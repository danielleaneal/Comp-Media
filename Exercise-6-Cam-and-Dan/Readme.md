Me and Cam took the "Kaleidoscope" example and the "Shake Ball Bounce"
examples to combine into one super trippy, extra kaleidoscope-y
example. We incorporated random colors, and a tiny bit of animation 
with the ellipse. 

1. The name and link to the module (and any example code or project you began from)

We derived our work from the "Kaleidoscope" and "Shake Ball Bounce" examples from
p5.js

2. Why did you select this library or module?

We chose these libraries because they enhanced each other in an interesting way,
and incorporated colors in ways that we could easily modify and make interesting 
effects happen. 

3. What changes did you make and why? How can you describe the "expressive space" the module affords?

We incorporated randomness in the color, we changed stroke, and added an ellipse to 
break up the visual elements. We changed the random colors to make it more visually
like an acid trip that you'd take in a real life kaleidoscope.

4. Provide two "pitches" for potential exhibits/works that would involve the module/affordance

- An interactive experience where instead of clicking a mouse to make the kaleidoscope,
you use a finger press to create this effect
- Interactive Art Installations

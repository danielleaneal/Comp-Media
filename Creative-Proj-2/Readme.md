For Creative Project #2, I made an Amazon Lex bot that talks about feelings. I worked with
some of the intents that I made in a previous exercise to modify them to have a unified theme,
covering the feelings of both the user and the bot, which I found satisfying and cheeky. 

I hope that this experience will be just that -- cheeky, and hopefully interesting. I also
got a little existential with the "AlexaCares" intent, trying to create a cool experience
to point at the motivations of a machine and whether bots can care like we humans do.
